# Stock Market Prediction using Stacked LSTM  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project predicts stock prices using **Stacked LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, a powerful deep learning approach for time-series forecasting. By training on historical stock data, the model learns patterns to forecast future closing prices.  

## ðŸš€ Features  
- **Deep Learning Model:** Implements a multi-layer (stacked) LSTM architecture.  
- **Data Processing:** Cleans, normalizes, and sequences stock data.  
- **Visualization:** Plots actual vs. predicted stock prices.  
- **Customizable:** Works with different stock datasets.
